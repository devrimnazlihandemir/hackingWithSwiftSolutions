//1  functional solution

let luckyNumbers = [7, 4, 38, 21, 16, 15, 12, 33, 31, 49]

let result = luckyNumbers.filter { $0.isMultiple(of: 2) == false }.sorted().map { " \($0) is a lucky number."}

for item in result {
    print(item)
}


//2 Going further but  it also doesnâ€™t really make our code easier to read 

let luckyNumbers = [7, 4, 38, 21, 16, 15, 12, 33, 31, 49]

luckyNumbers.filter { $0.isMultiple(of: 2) == false }.sorted().map { " \($0) is a lucky number." }.forEach { print($0) }
